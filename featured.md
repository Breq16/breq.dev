# ROBOTICS
Robotics has always been one of my favorite activities, due to the unique teamwork experience it provides. Over the years, I've gotten the chance to collaborate and compete on some incredible teams with incredible people.

# SUMMER 2020 PROJECTS
I've worked on a variety of personal "learning by doing" projects to help strengthen my skills. In summer 2020, due to the pandemic, I found myself with plenty of time at home, so I decided to focus on a few ambitious projects.

<br>

{% include slide.html video="/assets/videos/vibrance.webm" title="Vibrance" subtitle="I built Vibrance, a tool that synchronizes computers and smartphones to display configurable animations and effects. My goal was to create something useful for my brother and to learn more about optimizing computer networking and latency." link=link %}

{% include slide.html video="/assets/videos/lps.webm" title="Local Positioning System" subtitle="I designed and developed a simple, calibration-free, vision-based local positioning system intended for use with robotics. Doing this project helped me build real-world experience in computer vision and linear algebra." link=link %}

# OTHER COOL STUFF
Outside of that summer, I worked on quite a few smaller projects. Here are a couple of highlights.

<br>

{% capture link %}{% link _projects/breqbot.md %}{% endcapture %}
{% include slide.html image="/assets/images/pansexual.png" title="Breqbot" subtitle="During the pandemic, my friends and I spent a lot of time hanging out on Discord. So I made a Discord bot with minigames and utilities to add some character to our online space." link=link %}

{% capture link %}{% link _hacks/stmusic.md %}{% endcapture %}
{% include slide.html video="/assets/videos/music-game.webm" title="STMusic" subtitle="For a homework assignment, I was tasked with building a simple game for a STMicro Discovery board. I took it one step further, adding sound capabilities to the device to create a full Guitar-Hero-style game." link=link %}

<br>

# VERY OLD PROJECTS
I got started building these projects back in elementary and middle school. While most of them aren't anything notable, here are a few I'm still proud of.

<br>

{% include slide.html image="/assets/images/archives/makergamer.jpg" title="MakerGamer" subtitle="MakerGamer was a virtual video game console designed to make game development as simple as possible and to encourage the sharing of games. It could play games written in Scratch, Python, and JavaScript, and it provided simple tools to modify the games people downloaded." link=link %}
